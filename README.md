# Match Guess

Match Guesser is a web-based app that generates random football match predictions for users who want to participate in match prediction activities but are too lazy to generate the results themselves.

This app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Project Description

When the app is launched, users can input how many scores he needs, and the app will generate a random prediction for the match. The prediction will include the final score.
